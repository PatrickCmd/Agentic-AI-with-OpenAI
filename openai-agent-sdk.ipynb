    "The most common properties of an agent you'll configure are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **instructions**: also known as a developer message or system prompt.\n",
    "- **model**: which LLM to use, and optional model_settings to configure model tuning parameters like temperature, top_p, etc.\n",
    "- **tools**: Tools that the agent can use to achieve its tasks.\n",
